## Overview

### Introduction

Introducing Result Summary: A data-driven app for understanding your strengths and weaknesses

Result summary is a compitable site for any device that helps you gain insights into your skills and performance through personalized quizzes and data-driven results. Take a variety of tests, see your score compared to others, and get actionable feedback to improve your skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

Although I wouldn't classify my approach to this endeavor as strictly professional from a developer's standpoint, the experience has tremendously enriched my skill set. Unlike my previous project, the [QR code component](https://github.com/Code-Me-Well/QR-Code-Component), this undertaking has presented new and intriguing challenges, ultimately resulting in significant personal growth.

### Built With

- Classic combo: HTML for the bones and CSS for the beauty.
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive layouts and smooth transition, all powered by HTML and CSS magic.

### Continued Development

While there are specific technical skills like grid and flexbox I want to master in upcoming projects, the ultimate goal is to write responsive code into the very fabric of my development process. The frustration of crafting separate media query routines is a powerful motivator for me. I'm drawn to the challenge of building websites that inherently bend and flex, responding flawlessly to the diverse world of screen sizes and devices. It's a quest for adaptability that excites me, pushing me to think outside the box and craft experiences that are universally delightful, regardless of the platform.
